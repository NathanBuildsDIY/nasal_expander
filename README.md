My nose often plugs up at night and I wake up uncomfortable and mouth breathing. The doctor says I've got a partially deviated septum, and seasonal allergies sure don't help. Meds like Afrin can give relief, but even better is simply opening my nostrils mechanically, so I created a 3d printed nasal expander to do just that.  Print in PLA, 100% infill, no brim.  

If you want to try resizing it, I also posted the python code that runs as a freecad macro to create the 3d model. Just modify the values in that file and you'll get a 3d model that fits your nose better.

I'm no doctor so don't take this as medical advice, but if your nose plugs up and wakes you, it's worth checking with your doctor to see if a nasal expander would help
